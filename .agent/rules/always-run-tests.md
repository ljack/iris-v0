Always run tests after making changes.
After implementing any code changes (bug fixes, refactors, new features, or config updates), run the full relevant test suite.

If tests fail, fix the issues before proceeding.

If no tests exist for the affected area, add or update tests and run them.

Do not claim completion until tests pass or the absence of tests is explicitly documented.
