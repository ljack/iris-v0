      # Using || true to prevent failure from failing tests for now if desired, but typically CI should fail.
      # User requested "tests run", implying standard CI behavior (fail on error).
      # However, current codebase has many failing tests (202 failed). 
      # If I make it fail on error, the CI will always be red.
      # I will verify with the user or simply implement strict CI and let them fix tests.
      # Usually "CI" implies "Green Build". 
      # Validating if I should use `allow-failure` or similar? 
      # For now, I will run it strictly. If it fails, it fails correctly.
